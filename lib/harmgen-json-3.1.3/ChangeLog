Version 3.1.3, 20190202

Fixed code rot:  harmbase2 no longer has OIDs, so can't use OIDs in the
insert statement that harmgen outputs.


Version 3.1.2, 20180115

Harmonized congen_1yr.txt, congen_5yrs.txt, and congen_9yrs.txt with
congen_input.txt rev. 2018-01-14.

Fixed wrong error message when congen input fails to parse.

Updated build scripts.

Updated README and installed it to pkgdatadir.


Version 3.1.1, 20150604

Added -i to octave command line in harmgen.sh to fix code rot that was
introduced somewhere between Octave version 3.4.3 (worked) and 4.0.0 (did not
work).  Without -i, Octave now ignores the function definition, even if there
is other code preceding it.  Thanks to Larry Hynes for reporting the problem.


Version 3.1, 20080523

Added the --minamplitude, --datum_override, and --force command-line options.

Added missing include for string.h (needed to compile under gcc 4.3.0).


Version 3, 20071101

Split the ever-changing extras out into a separate tarball from
harmgen.

Automaked harmgen.

Relicensed under GPLv3.

Completely rewrote harmgen.c (now harmgen.cc) and completely changed
all interfaces.

  - To get constituent definitions, Harmgen now reads a Congen input
    file instead of parsing an old harmonics.txt file.
  - To output the new station, Harmgen now writes an SQL script that
    loads the station into Harmbase2 instead of writing data in
    harmonics.txt format.
  - To accept optional station metadata, Harmgen now uses command line
    switches instead of "header files."

Added checks to ensure that the time series is long enough to resolve
long-term constituents and to separate constituents from one another.

If the input file has a format error, harmgen now reports the error
instead of treating it as end-of-file.

Made compatible with Octave 2.9.15 (and thus hopefully with Octave
3.x).


Version 2.2 r6, 20050905

No changes to Harmgen; incorporated updates to bundled extras (added
MEDS stuff, nit fixes).


Version 2.2 r5, 2005-06-16

Updated e-mail contact in README.


Version 2.2 r4, 2005-06-05

No changes to Harmgen per se -- same version re-released to
incorporate updates to bundled extras (revised BODC stuff) and revise
README.

Tested with Octave 2.1.69.


Version 2.2 r3, 2004-09-14

No changes to Harmgen per se -- same version re-released to
incorporate updates to bundled extras (added BSH stuff).


Version 2.2 r2, 2003-11-24

No changes to Harmgen per se -- same version re-released to
incorporate updates to bundled extras (added BODC stuff).


Version 2.2, 2003-11-16

Tested with Octave 2.1.50.

Significant revisions to README.

Added sample harmonics input to distribution.

Added maxconstituents option.

Added header file option.

Output more useful information in header comments.

Synced tm2utc from XTide 2.6.3.

If amp is zero out to four decimals, null out amp and phase.


Version 2.1, 2000-01-26

Using explanation from Bjoern Brill, extended to use data from multiple
years.  You no longer need to specify the year on the command line.

Shut off Octave's verbose logging for a big savings of CPU time.

Synced tm2utc from XTide 2.2 to get a patch fixing a 64-bit time_t issue.


Version 2.0, 1998-09-15

Ditched APL for Octave.  Discovered that the APL had been giving really bad
results.


Version 1.0.2, 1998-08-14

Removed a duplicate fclose.


Version 1.0.1, 1998-08-14

Fixed up a bunch of error messages that were printing the wrong file names.


Version 1.0, 1998-08-13
