# congen_9yrs.txt was derived from congen_input.txt rev. 2018-01-14 by
# commenting out constituents that had exactly or almost exactly the same
# speed as previous ones.  congen_5yrs.txt and congen_1yr.txt were in turn
# derived from congen_9yrs.txt by commenting out constituents that were
# different yet still too close in speed to be separated by analyses using
# shorter time serieses.

# Format of input:

#
# Overview
# --------
#
# Congen and the congen_input.txt file were designed originally to
# implement the system used by the US National Ocean Service (NOS), aka the
# Darwin system.  Support for Doodson-style constituents as used by Mike
# Foreman's original IOS package is only approximate; most importantly,
# latitude-dependent satellites are discarded.  The International
# Hydrographic Organization (IHO) has yet another way of calculating node
# factors which is not supported at all.
#
# The first 37 constituents in this file are those that the NOS
# historically used for most stations, with names as they appeared in Ed
# Wallner's TIDES4 program and in the original IOS tidal package.  After
# that, constituents were simply appended if and when they were needed to
# make use of data from disparate sources, with names either as appearing
# therein or as previously defined herein.  Those seeking a more cohesive
# list of constituents with some logical ordering might consult one of the
# following sources:
#
#   [IHO] "Standard list of tidal constituents" from the Tide, Water Level
#   and Current Working Group (TWCWG) of the IHO, rev. 2017-05, lists many
#   constituents ordered by speed along with their Extended Doodson Numbers
#   (XDO).
#
#   [SP98] Manual of Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of Tides.  Special
#   Publication No. 98, Revised (1940) Edition (reprinted 1958 with
#   corrections; reprinted again 1994).  Table 2 summarizes all of the
#   constituents used in SP98.
#
#   NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS CO-OPS 0021, "Tidal current analysis
#   procedures and associated computer programs," 1999-03, contains a table
#   of 175 constituents "in standard order," but the standard is not
#   identified.
#
# For details of Congen operation please consult the README file.
#
# Nomenclature
# ------------
#
# Most constituents end with a digit that indicates their species (number
# of cycles per day), which also is the coefficient of T.  The exceptions
# are:
#
# - In this file we add a hyphen and a suffix to distinguish conflicting
#   definitions with the same name, such as OQ2 and OQ2-HORN.
#
# - Table 2 in SP98 assigns a serial reference number of the form ANN or
#   BNN to many constituents that do not have assigned symbols.  In the
#   absence of another name, these reference numbers get used.
#
# - H1 is an alias for ALP2 and has T=2.
#
# Changes (2018-01)
# -----------------
#
# There were no changes to congen_input.txt between August 2004 and January
# 2018.  The purpose of the 2018-01 revision is to incorporate the findings
# of an investigation into discrepant constituents in National Ocean
# Service data which specifically affect station 9455920, Anchorage,
# Alaska.
#
# The definition of constituent 3KM5 has been changed from 3K1+M2 to
# K1+M2+K2.  This approximately reverses its phase and alters its node
# factors.  Although the superseded definition was consistent with IHO
# (2017), the new definition is the one that was used in the paper that
# introduced the use of many constituents for Anchorage (Bernard D. Zetler
# and Robert A. Cummings, A harmonic method for predicting shallow-water
# tides, J. Marine Res. 25(1), pp. 103-114, 1967) and is also the one used
# by IOS (2006).
#
# The new constituent KJ2-IHO is simply a phase reversal of the SP98
# definition of KJ2 to make it consistent with IHO and the NOS data for
# Anchorage.  As defined in this file, KJ2 and ETA2 are two different
# formulations of what IHO and IOS call ETA2.  KJ2 is one of the
# constituents that is inferred by libtcd using an SP98 rule-of-thumb which
# assumes a consistent treatment of the constituents' phases; flipping KJ2
# from its SP98 definition would be more likely to break this inference
# than to fix it.
#
# A third discrepancy was resolved without changes to this file.  The
# definitions of RP1 and PSI1 (which are the same thing but flipped 180
# degrees) are consistent with IHO, with the SP98 definition of PSI1, and
# with the IOS definition of PSI1.  To reduce error for Anchorage, the RP1
# constituent is just mapped to PSI1 by the import program of Harmbase2.
#
# Quirks in SP98 and the NOS system
# ---------------------------------
#
# NOS node factors for M1 contain a historical error that make them about
# 50% greater than they should be.  M1 amplitudes in harmonic constants
# from NOS are correspondingly smaller to compensate.
#
# M1 has two formulas in SP 98 Table 2.  The first yields the correct speed
# for the constituent, while the second yields the correct equilibrium
# arguments (SP 98 p. 42).  The correct thing to do *here* is to use the
# second formula since Congen automatically compensates the speed when the
# Q variable gets a nonzero multiplier.
#   M1  Basic  1 -1 1 0 0 -90    1 -1 0 0 1 0     206
#   Speed = 14.4966939
#
# About M1 Wallner wrote:
#   In SP98, "Manual of Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of Tides" two
#   approaches are given for M1, which is a combination of two terms in
#   Darwin's theory, A16 and A23. (Why wasn't A71 included in the
#   combination? It is labelled (M1) in Table 2, its speed is half that of
#   M2 and its coefficient is larger than that of A16 or A23!!)
#
#   V0 for the first  is T -s +h +p -90° and u is    -nu -Qu.
#   V0 for the second is T -s +h    -90° and u is xi -nu +Q.
#
#   The terms Qu and Q are such that the equilibrium arguments at the start
#   of the prediction interval are the same but the variable p is absorbed
#   in Q in the second method and held fixed for the interval. Not only are
#   there two approaches, alternate formulas are given for some equations
#   in which some elements are replaced by their mean values. The tables in
#   SP98 use these approximations.
#
# MSF or MSf is not derived using the formula in Table 2 but is actually SM
# (S2-M2); see SP98 p. 48.  This causes u to be nonzero.
#
# KJ2 is phase-reversed from its IHO definition and matches IHO's ETA2 at
# least as far as speed and equilibrium arguments.  The IOS ETA2 is a close
# match.
#
# OO2 appears to be a mistranscription of OQ2, specifically the one that
# herein is defined as OQ2-HORN.
#
# Aliases and conflicts
# ---------------------
#
# The "Explanation of symbols used in this book" at the end of SP98
# contains several statements to the effect that one constituent is the
# same as another:
#
#         Claim                IHO list              congen_input.txt
#   Theta1 = LambdaO1   Opposite phase, nodes j, x   No LambdaO1
#   Mu2 = 2MS2          Agree? nodes m, x            No 2MS2
#   Pi1 = TK1           Agree? nodes z, x            Eq args and nodes differ
#   Rho1 = NuK1         Agree? nodes o, x            No NuK1
#   Sigma1 = NuJ1       Agree!                       No NuJ1
#   Phi1 = KP1          Agree? nodes j, x            Eq args and nodes differ
#   Chi1 = LP1          Opposite phase, nodes j, x   No LP1
#   Psi1 = RP1          Opposite phase, nodes z, x   Opposite phase
#
# (I have not computed the IHO nodal corrections to determine in which
# cases the two letters quoted above indicate the same result.)
#
# Constituent names are unreliable identifiers.  The IHO list contains
# enough examples where the same name has multiple, conflicting
# definitions.  Data sets may use idiosyncratic constituents or just
# idiosyncratic names for already-defined constituents.
#
# Sequences of letters get permuted, such as 3MSN10 in lieu of 3MNS10.
#
# The reduction of Greek letters to flat ASCII is arbitrary and prone to
# aliasing.  NU and V get interchanged a lot.
#
# H1 is an alias for ALP2; H2 is an alias for BET2.
#
# The Canadian and NOS systems have some subtle differences and some not so
# subtle.  Constituents SA-IOS, MF-IOS, S1-IOS, OO1-IOS, and R2-IOS
# approximate Canadian definitions that clash with NOS definitions having
# the same name.
#
# As defined in this file, some pairs of constituents appear to be Darwin
# and Doodson formulations of the same underlying constituent or very
# similar constituents.  The different formulations produce differences in
# equilibrium arguments and node factors which may be genuine or may be
# artifacts of the latitude-dependent satellites being discarded by Congen.
#
#   MNS2 and EPS2      IHO: nodes x, m
#   KQ1 and UPS1       IHO: nodes x, d
#
# BET1 may match the unused A19 constituent in SP98 Table 2.
#
# The IHO list has two definitions of MP1 and one of TAU1 that all have the
# same speed.  As defined in this file, MP1 and TAU1 have significantly
# different equilibrium arguments and node factors.
#
# Speed collisions between different compound constituents are not so rare;
# quite a few exist in this file.  Sometimes they are approximately
# equivalent and sometimes they are not.
#
# Other definitions of M1 / NO1
# -----------------------------
#
# Canada uses NO1 = N2 - O1.  They don't use a constituent named M1.
#
# Regarding Japan's M1, Wallner wrote (1997):
#   The text with the Japanese constituents I got a little over two year
#   ago gives the argument of M1 as T - s + h - 90 as in the second NOS
#   definition.  The node factor f and phase u are defined by:
#     f cos(u) = 2 * cos(p) + 0.4 cos(p-N)
#     f sin(u) =     sin(p) + 0.2 sin(p-N)
#   This gives essentially the NOS values.
#
# Upon further review in year 2000, Wallner wrote:
#   The Japanese u and f are reasonably close to the second SP98
#   formulation.  The Japanese constituent phases could be "corrected" to
#   work with first formulation in TIDES by subtracting p, but since this
#   is a variable that's not much help.  Considering it a new constituent,
#   or a different version of M1, would work better.  The German M1 has the
#   right speed, half that of M2, but I'm not sure what u and f are for it.
#   The IHO data set has both M1 and NO1, but again I'm not sure what their
#   M1 is.  The French M1 appears to be NO1 exactly.  The Mexican data I
#   have include another undefined M1.
#
# Regarding Horn's publications, which have M1 = A71 but also NO1, Casement
# wrote:
#   I can't agree with his notation here.  What he calls NO1 is a
#   lunisolar tide and would be better called M1 - as it is by other
#   authors.  His M1 is in fact a shallow-water tide (= M3 - M2 +
#   180°) and would be better called MM1.
#
# The Dutch define the following constituents:
#   M1  = SP98 term M1 formula #1 on p. 165 (I have called this M1-DUTCH)
#   M1A = SP98 term A23
#   M1B = SP98 term A16
#   M1C = SP98 term A71
#   M1D = SP98 term M1 formula #2 on p. 165
# M1A, M1B, and M1D are not used in the data I have received.  M1C is.
# M1-DUTCH is used indirectly in the building of M7 (complete with
# exaggerated node factors).  The IOS formulation of M7 is 3.5 * M2!
#
# M1 is a minor constituent that doesn't deserve to be such an
# inconvenience.  Future producers of harmonic constants are advised to
# abolish M1 and just use NO1.
#
# Other "problem" constituents
# ----------------------------
#
# Constituent OQ2 has been defined as
# - O1+Q1 (herein called OQ2-HORN, used by Netherlands)
# - Ibid. with a 180 degree shift (not included here)
# - A different definition used by Canada/IOS (herein called OQ2).
# Only the first two appear in the IHO list.
#
# Mexican data contain A7 and LDA1.  Wallner wrote:
#   The data set in the Anales del Instituto d Geofisica, v14 pp45-69
#   (1969) give 47 constituents for 23 stations. There is no LDA1 but both
#   A4 and A7 are included. These are presumably are those terms in Table 2
#   of SP98, which is one of the references in the article. My marginalia
#   say A4 = MsM and A7 = Mtm.
