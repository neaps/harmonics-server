This program is mostly derived from the following publication (SP 98):

   Manual of Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of Tides.  Special
   Publication No. 98, Revised (1940) Edition (reprinted 1958 with
   corrections; reprinted again 1994).  United States Government
   Printing Office, 1994.

Special credit is due to the late Ed Wallner for mentoring me on the
black magic that Congen does.  This included pointing out errors that
I made in interpreting SP 98 and providing source code for the
spherical trig functions that SP 98 left as an exercise for the
reader.

I am also indebted to Mike Foreman and other contributors to the IOS
tidal package
(http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/osap/projects/tidpack/tidpack_e.htm).
Although I recycled no source code from IOS, the approximation of
Doodson-style constituents was based entirely on the documentation and
data that were once publicly available on the IOS web site.  The site
is now password-protected.
