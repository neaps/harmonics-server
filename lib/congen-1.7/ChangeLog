Version 1.7, 2018-01-14:

  congen_input.txt: changed definition of 3KM5; added KJ2-IHO; revised the
  verbose header commentary.

  Added scripts XDO2Basic.rb and Compound2Basic.rb.

  Updated build scripts.  Fixed race between congen program and libcongen in
  parallel builds.  Deleted autoconf check for GCC older than 3.4 since
  autoreconf now spews nuisance warnings about the test code and nobody is
  going to have such an old GCC anymore anyway.

  Installed diff_congen_output into bin along with the new scripts.
  Installed congen_input.txt and README into pkgdatadir.

  No changes to libcongen or the congen app.

Version 1.6.2, 2013-02-17:

  (Code rot) Added const to compound literals to work around compilation
  failure under GCC 4.7.x and resolve Gentoo Bug 457992.  Bug report credit:
  Diego Elio Pettenò, Julian Ospald.  The underlying problem is described in
  GCC Bug 53220, especially the "new error is too strict" exchange of
  2012-06-20.

Version 1.6.1 release 2, 2012-01-04:

  (Usability) Versions of GCC older than 3.4 are now unconditionally rejected
  by configure.

  (Usability) Added autoconf check for existence of STL.

  (Code rot) Regenerated all build scripts.

  Absolutely nothing was changed in the programs themselves.  This is simply
  a repackaging and re-release of Version 1.6.1 with better build scripts.
  It is not necessary to "upgrade" if Version 1.6.1 is already installed.

Version 1.6.1, 2010-05-22:
  (Code rot) Added #include <cstring> to satisfy g++ 4.4.3.

Version 1.6, 2007-08-18:

  Rewrote everything.  Purged gratuitous complexity.  Stopped trying
  to share code with XTide.

  Moved the useful functionality into a separate library, libcongen,
  declared in the header file Congen.  The program congen is now a
  thin client of this library.  Other programs needing to generate
  constituents (such as harmbase) can do so using libcongen,
  eliminating the need for temporary files and an invocation of the
  congen program.

  Dropped support for the obsolete command-line options -a0 and -map.

  Added congen switch -tcd to create a TCD file directly in lieu of
  producing the usual text format output, if libtcd is available.

  Automake'd the distribution.
  - Not using AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.
  - make dist-bzip2 does the right thing.

  Relicensed under GPLv3.

  Purged FYI directory; added URLs to README instead.

Version 1.5, 2006-08-25:
  Made -a1 the default.
  Put updated IHO constituents PDF in FYI subdirectory.

Version 1.4.9r2, 2005-02-16:
  Moved extraneous constituent definition info into FYI subdirectory.
  Added spreadsheet from Art Najjar to the collection.
  No changes to the software.

Version 1.4.9, 2004-10-19:
  Removed extra semicolons in Angle.cc.

Version 1.4.8, 2004-09-29:
  Fixed spelling of XTide in output comments.
  Removed trailing spaces from constituent names in output.
  Fixed an assertion failure caused by floating point roundoff.
  Cleaned up compiler warnings, added -Wall to CFLAGS.

Version 1.4.7r2, 2004-08-16:
  Minor updates in README.
  Added congen_input.txt and Constituents.pdf.
  No changes to the software.

Version 1.4.7, 2004-08-15:
  Finally tracked down and killed the intermittent bug that sometimes
  caused constituents to get speeds like 27516r+210.0293159 when
  congen was compiled with certain versions of certain compilers.
  There was a variable that needed to be initialized to zero.

Version 1.4.6, 2003-02-20:
  Expunged 'bool' in favor of more portable int.
  Added -lm to Makefile.

Version 1.4.5, 2003-01-17:
  Added a LL suffix to the long long int literal to make GCC 2.95.x happy
  with it.

Version 1.4.4, 2002-12-23:
  Added return statement to assignment operator in TabulatedConstituent.
  This return is not used but some compilers required it.

Version 1.4.3, 2002-12-20:
  If interval_rep_t is bigger than time_t, cast the times to
  interval_rep_t before subtracting.

Version 1.4.2, 2002-12-19:
  'long long int' is not necessarily the one we wanted -- patched in
  logic to determine the correct data type.
  Fixed delete [] syntax.

Version 1.4.1, 2002-12-11:
  Fixed two memory leaks introduced in 1.4.

Version 1.4, 2002-12-10:
  Worked around 32-bit time_t to enable years before 1970 and after 2037.
  Added "level of ambition" control for fundamental astronomical calculations.
  Added switches to set begin and end years.
  Added -sp98test switch.
  Fixed old dangling semicolon error in Dstr.cc.
  Expunged C++ streams.
  Deleted some of the code that was carried over from XTide but is useless
    in Congen.
  Worked around a tricky overload resolution bug related to
    TabulatedConstituent's copy constructor and assignment operators.

Version 1.3, 2001-01-10:
  In congen.hh, changed stream.h to iostream.h.
  In Dstr.cc, fixed a syntax nit.
  Added node formula 144 for M1C.
  Fixed bug in line numbers given by error messages.
  Changed input format to explicitly specify Basic, Compound, or Doodson.
  Added NU2, S1, M1-DUTCH, and LDA2 as compoundable basic constituents.
  Enabled compound constituent multipliers to be real numbers.  (The
  IOS formulation of M7 is 3.5 * M2 !)

Version 1.2.1, 2000-04-16:  Fixed segfault on Doodson constituents
having zero satellites.

Version 1.2, 2000-04-11:  Added support for approximating Doodson
constituents based on Foreman, M.G.G., Manual for Tidal Heights
Analysis and Prediction, Pacific Marine Science Report 77-10,
Institute of Ocean Sciences, Patricia Bay, Sidney, B.C., 1977 (revised
1996).  Available from
http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/osap/projects/tidpack/tidpack_e.htm.

Version 1.1, 1997-08-03:  Added Q1 to the constituents used to
generate compound constituents.

Version 1.0 released 1997-07-29
